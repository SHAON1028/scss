# SCSS Project

SCSS (Sassy CSS) is a preprocessor scripting language that extends CSS with additional functionality like variables, nesting, mixins, inheritance, and more. It helps developers write more maintainable and scalable styles, making it easier to manage large CSS files by providing features commonly found in programming languages.

## What is SCSS?

SCSS is a superset of CSS, which means every valid CSS file is also a valid SCSS file. SCSS allows for more advanced CSS development by introducing features such as:

- **Variables**: For defining reusable values (like colors, fonts, sizes).
- **Mixins**: Reusable blocks of code that can be included in multiple places.
- **Nesting**: To organize CSS selectors in a more readable and structured way.
- **Inheritance**: To share common styles between different selectors.

By compiling SCSS into regular CSS, developers can write more efficient and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code.

## Variables

SCSS allows you to define variables to store values like colors, fonts, and sizes, making it easier to change these values throughout the project without editing each instance manually. This improves consistency and maintainability.
